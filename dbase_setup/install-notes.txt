Project Phase E due May 11, 11 p.m.

There is no particular order necessary, but the following sql
files must be executed before using the database.

setup.sql or setup-small.sql
Query1.sql
Query2.sql
Query3.sql
Query4.sql
Query4.sql
Query5.sql
Query6.sql
Query7.sql
Query8.sql
Query9.sql
Query10.sql
Query11.sql

This can generally be done with execution within the public_html folder:
cat *.sql | mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u 21sp_scabrej1 -D 21sp_scabrej1_db -p

but individual execution will suffice as well.
